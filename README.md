# Course: TEAL Self-Regulated Learning
This Moodle course is for Self-Regulated Learning. Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) refers to one's ability to understand and control one's learning behaviors. For the learner to do this, he or she must set goals, select the strategies to achieve the goals, and monitor progress towards the goals. In monitoring his or her progress, the learner can determine if a particular learning strategy is not working and he/she can modify the approach to mastering a skill. All of these activities, which can be customized to any content area, can help refine learners' attention to and confidence in learning and reinforcing specific habits, strategies, and skills. You can expect to complete this course in approximately 6 hours as you explore strategies for encouraging students to self-regulate their learning and for applying those strategies to the adult education context. You are asked to complete at least one of the assignments.
